  "It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.",
  "My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense then with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation.",
  "When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.",
  "The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.",

  "Education never ends, Watson. It is a series of lessons, with the greatest for the last.",
  "I am not a whole-souled admirer of womankind, as you are aware, Watson, but my experience of life has taught me that there are few wives, having any regard for their husbands, who would let any man's spoken word stand between them and that husband's dead body.",
  "There is nothing more stimulating than a case where everything goes against you.",

  "Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner. You have attempted to tinge it with romanticism, which produces much the same effect as if you worked a love-story or an elopement into the fifth proposition of Euclid.",
  "The most difficult crime to track is the one which is purposeless.",
  "The lowest and vilest alleys of London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.",

  "The only way to learn the limits of the possible is to go beyond them into the impossible.",
  "There are always some lunatics about. It would be a dull world without them.",
  "When one tries to rise above Nature one is liable to fall below it.",
